covering Subscriptions, Resource Groups, Scopes, RBAC, Governance, Billing, with examples, scenarios, outcomes, and reasoning. I’ll also make it structured and ready for corporate training.

Azure Subscriptions & Resource Groups Training

Authored by Vishwanath

Version: 1.0
Target Audience: Developers, DevOps Engineers, IT Admins, Corporate Teams

1. Objective

This training module will teach you how to:

Understand Azure hierarchy and scopes

Work with subscriptions and resource groups (RGs)

Apply RBAC roles at different scopes

Implement governance and policies

Track billing and cost management

2. Why This Training is Important

Azure resources are vast and complex. Proper understanding of subscriptions and RGs is critical to:

Organize resources logically for dev/test/prod environments

Apply security controls with least privilege

Enforce compliance and governance policies

Track costs and optimize cloud spending

3. Key Concepts
Concept	Description	Example	Why Needed
Tenant	Azure AD instance	vishwaops.onmicrosoft.com	Central identity, manages all users & groups
Management Group	Organizes subscriptions	Corp-Mgmt	Apply governance policies to multiple subscriptions
Subscription	Billing + resource container	Dev-Subscription, Prod-Subscription	Separate costs, quotas, and policies
Resource Group (RG)	Logical container for resources	Dev-RG1, Prod-RG1	Manage lifecycle, access, and cost per project
Resource	Actual Azure service	VM, Storage Account, App Service	The cloud asset you deploy
Scope	Where RBAC is applied	Subscription, RG, Resource	Control permissions efficiently
RBAC Roles	Assign permissions	Owner, Contributor, Reader	Least privilege access management
Policies & Governance	Rules enforcement	Allowed VM sizes, Allowed Regions	Ensure compliance and security
Billing & Cost Management	Track usage and cost	Cost per RG, subscription	Optimize cloud spending
4. Azure Hierarchy Overview

Azure resources are structured as follows:

Tenant → Management Group → Subscription → Resource Group → Resource


Example Scenario:

Tenant: vishwaops.onmicrosoft.com

Management Group: Corp-Mgmt → Dev / Prod subscriptions

Subscription: Dev-Subscription → RG: Dev-RG1

Resource: VM, Storage Account

Outcome: Logical separation, governance, cost tracking, and access control.

5. Hands-On Steps
Step 1: Create a Resource Group

Azure Portal → Resource Groups → + Create

Select Subscription, enter Name (e.g., Dev-RG1) → Region → Review + Create
Expected Outcome: RG created successfully; ready for resources

Step 2: Assign RBAC Roles

Navigate to RG → Access Control (IAM) → + Add → Role Assignment

Assign Contributor → Select user (e.g., dev@company.com) → Save
Scenario: Dev team member can create/manage VMs only in Dev-RG1
Expected Outcome: Least privilege applied; cannot modify other RGs

Step 3: Deploy Resource (VM)

RG → + Add → Virtual Machine → Fill details → Review + Create
Scenario: Dev team deploys VM inside Dev-RG1
Expected Outcome: Resources contained within RG; RBAC enforced

Step 4: Apply Governance & Policies

Subscription → Policies → Assign → Select policy (e.g., allowed VM sizes)
Scenario: Restrict VMs to Standard_B2s
Expected Outcome: Policy blocks non-compliant resources → ensures compliance

Step 5: Track Billing & Cost

Subscription → Cost Management + Billing → Cost Analysis → Filter by RG
Scenario: Compare costs for Dev-RG1 vs Prod-RG1
Expected Outcome: Understand per-project cost; manage budgets efficiently

6. Real-World Scenarios
Scenario	Steps	Outcome
Dev team provisioning	Create RG → Assign Contributor → Deploy VM	Dev can deploy/manage VMs in RG only
QA team read-only	Assign Reader role at subscription or RG	QA can view resources but not modify
IT admin governance	Assign policy to limit VM size	Users comply with rules automatically
Cost tracking	Tag resources per project	Cost visible per RG/project
7. Expected Learning Outcomes

Create and manage RGs

Assign RBAC roles at subscription and RG level

Deploy and manage resources within RBAC scope

Apply policies for governance

Track and optimize billing and cost per RG/subscription

8. Why We Do This

Control & Organization: Resources grouped logically for lifecycle management

Security: RBAC ensures least privilege access

Governance: Policies enforce company compliance

Cost Management: Track spending per project or subscription
