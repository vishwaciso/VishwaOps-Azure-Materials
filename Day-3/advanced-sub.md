### Part 1 â€” Verify billing account access

1. Sign in to **[https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)** with a **Billing Administrator** or **Owner** role.
2. In the search bar, type **Cost Management + Billing** and open it.
3. Confirm you can see all 10 subscriptions under your tenant. If not, ensure theyâ€™re all associated with the same Azure AD directory and billing account.

### Part 2 â€” Consolidate billing (Enrollment or Billing Account)

1. In **Cost Management + Billing**, select **Billing scopes**.
2. Choose the **Billing account** or **Enrollment account** that covers your organization.
3. Verify that all 10 subscriptions are listed.

   * If not, link subscriptions to the billing account by following prompts: **Add subscription** â†’ select tenant â†’ confirm.
4. Once linked, all subscriptions will roll up to a single consolidated invoice.

### Part 3 â€” Run consolidated cost analysis

1. In the **Cost Management + Billing** blade, click **Cost Management** â†’ **Cost analysis**.
2. At the top, set the **Scope** to the **Billing account** (not a single subscription).
3. Verify costs from all 10 subscriptions appear combined.
4. Use the **Group by** option to split costs by **Subscription name** or **Resource group**.
5. Use **Filters** to analyze costs per region or department.

### Part 4 â€” Verification for learners

* Learners must show a screenshot of **Cost analysis** at the **Billing account scope** with all subscriptions included.
* Learners should highlight cost breakdown per subscription to confirm consolidation.

**Expected outcome:** One consolidated invoice covers all 10 subscriptions, and costs are visible in a single view.

* Build a Power BI dashboard from **Cost Management exports**.
* Apply **Tags** or **Management groups** to further refine cost rollups.
